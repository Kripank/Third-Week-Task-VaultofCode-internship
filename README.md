# Third-Week-Task-VaultofCode-internship
During the third week of the Java programming internship at VaultofCode, I completed the task of creating a mini-project that involved developing a "Password Strength Indicator" for a website's login page
Project Overview:
The primary goal of this project was to build a graphical user interface (GUI) application in Java that allows users to enter their username and password for logging into a website. In addition to the basic login functionality, the application includes a feature that evaluates the strength of the entered password and provides feedback to the user.

Key Components and Features:

Login Page GUI: I designed a user-friendly login page with the following components:

Username input field.
Password input field.
A "Submit" button.
Password Strength Indicator: The application calculates the strength of the entered password based on specific criteria, such as length, the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Strength Feedback: The application displays the password strength as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong" to the user. This information is presented as a text label.

Password Criteria: The application informs the user about the password criteria, providing guidance on what elements are necessary to create a stronger password. This information is displayed below the password strength label.

Validation and User Feedback: Users are provided with feedback when the "Submit" button is clicked. If the password is empty, the application shows an alert instructing the user to enter a password. Upon submission, if the password is strong, it displays a "Thank you" message.

GUI Styling: To enhance the visual appeal, I applied various styles to the GUI, including font size adjustments and the use of shadow borders for the login components.

This mini-project not only offers a practical login page but also helps users create stronger passwords, which is crucial for the security of their accounts.

Overall, the completion of this third-week task demonstrates the ability to develop a user-friendly Java application with a graphical interface that addresses both user authentication and security concerns by evaluating password strength.
